# Netflix Content Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of Netflix's content library, focusing on TV shows and movies available as of 2019. The project aims to explore trends, preferences, and insights related to Netflix's content strategy using data from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to address the following key questions and objectives:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze Netflix's content library to identify patterns, trends, and key statistics. This includes exploring genres, ratings, duration, and release years.

2. **Content Type by Country:** Investigate whether the country of origin influences the type of content (TV shows or movies) available on Netflix.

3. **Focus on TV vs. Movies:** Analyze whether Netflix's content strategy has shifted towards TV shows over movies in recent years. Perform statistical tests to determine significant differences in the distribution of content types.

4. **Content Clustering:** Use text-based features to cluster similar content on Netflix, potentially revealing distinct groups of shows and movies based on textual information like titles, descriptions, and genres.

## Dataset
